## MicroPython / Casio Calculator Projects

- Never use f-strings as they are invalid syntax in MicroPython
- Time module is not available in MicroPython.
- Use string concatenation with + operator and str() function instead (e.g., "Score: " + str(score))
- Alternatively, use .format() method for string formatting
- Assume code needs to be compatible with MicroPython limitations
- All files must have a maximum of 300 lines. Use `wc -l <file>` to check the number of lines.
- `random.shuffle` is not available.
